Many of the test objectives were achieved, including precision control of the rocket's descent to land on the platform at a specific point in the Atlantic ocean, and a large amount of test data was obtained from the first use of grid fin control surfaces used for more precise reentry positioning.

The DART spacecraft will intercept the double asteroid, using autonomous guidance to crash into the smaller one. Moving at about 6 km/s, the transferred momentum should alter Dimorphos's 12 hour orbital period around its companion by several minutes.

DART should arrive at Didymos in late September 2022, when it is about 11 million kilometers from Earth. Ten days before impact, the Italian Space Agency's cubesat LICIACube will be deployed to observe the collision and ejecta with its two cameras.

The satellite will be launched into space onboard the Falcon 9 rocket following pre-launch preparations. With an estimated in-orbit lifetime of 30 years and the aim of securing Turkey’s orbital and frequency rights, Türksat 5B will be launched into an orbital slot at 42 degrees East. With 12 kW power, Türksat 5B will provide TV broadcasting and data communication services over a wide coverage area that reaches the entire Middle East, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean, North Africa, East Africa, South Africa and Nigeria. Apart from that, the satellite will also provide customized services for airlines and commercial ship operators around the world thanks to the fact that it operates in Ka-Band.	2021	t
